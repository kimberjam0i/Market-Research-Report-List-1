<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smoke and Fire Control Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>Spring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Smoke and Fire Control Valve market primarily features two types: gravity and spring valves. Gravity valves operate based on gravitational forces, automatically closing when smoke or fire is detected, allowing for passive smoke control without the need for additional power. In contrast, spring valves utilize a spring mechanism to maintain closure and require an external trigger, such as smoke detection systems, to open or close. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing fire safety by controlling smoke movement in buildings.</p></p>
