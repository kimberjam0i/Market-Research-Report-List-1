<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The KrF Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive KrF Resist</li><li>Negative KrF Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The KrF resist market is categorized into positive and negative types based on their photoresist behavior when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Positive KrF resists polymerize and become soluble upon exposure, allowing for the creation of desired patterns, making them suitable for fine-feature lithography. In contrast, negative KrF resists polymerize and become insoluble, forming patterns that are the inverse of the original exposure. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p></p>
