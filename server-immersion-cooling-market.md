<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Immersion Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-phase</li><li>Two-phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The server immersion cooling market is categorized into two main types: single-phase and two-phase cooling. Single-phase cooling utilizes a dielectric fluid that remains in a liquid state, absorbing heat from servers before being recirculated. In contrast, two-phase cooling involves a liquid that vaporizes upon absorbing heat, cycling between liquid and gas states, which enhances heat removal efficiency. Both types provide effective thermal management solutions, but two-phase systems generally offer higher cooling efficiency and reduced energy consumption.</p></p>
