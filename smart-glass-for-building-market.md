<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Glass for Building Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Glasses</li><li>Passive Glasses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The smart glass market for buildings is divided into two main types: active and passive glasses. Active glasses, such as electrochromic and thermochromic options, dynamically change their properties in response to external stimuli, allowing for adjustable light control and energy efficiency. In contrast, passive glasses, like photochromic and self-tinting varieties, react to ambient light conditions without the need for external power, providing natural daylight regulation and temperature control. Both types enhance building comfort while promoting sustainable energy use.</p></p>
