<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Seal</li><li>Non-contact Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dynamic seals market is primarily divided into two types: contact seals and non-contact seals. Contact seals create a tight seal by maintaining direct physical contact with the moving surfaces, offering effective fluid retention and preventing leakage, commonly used in applications like automotive engines. In contrast, non-contact seals function without touching the surfaces, minimizing wear and friction, making them suitable for high-speed applications where reduced maintenance is crucial, such as in many industrial machinery and aerospace components.</p></p>
