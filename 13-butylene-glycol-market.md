<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1,3-butylene Glycol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Synthesis</li><li>Fermentation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 1,3-butylene glycol market can be segmented into two main types: chemical synthesis and fermentation. </p><p>Chemical synthesis involves the catalytic conversion of petroleum-derived feedstocks, resulting in a more direct and efficient production process. This approach typically yields higher purity and less variability in quality. </p><p>In contrast, fermentation utilizes biological processes, involving microorganisms to convert biomass into 1,3-butylene glycol. This sustainable method often appeals to environmentally-conscious consumers but can be less efficient and slower than chemical synthesis, impacting production scalability. </p></p>
