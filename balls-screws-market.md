<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balls Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Circulation Ball Screw</li><li>External Circulation Ball Screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ball screws are precision mechanical components that convert rotational motion into linear motion using balls. In the market, they are categorized into two primary types: internal circulation and external circulation ball screws. Internal circulation ball screws feature a design where balls circulate within the screw nut, providing efficient movement and compactness. In contrast, external circulation ball screws allow balls to flow externally between the nut and the screw, facilitating better load distribution and enabling longer lengths, making them suitable for various industrial applications.</p></p>
