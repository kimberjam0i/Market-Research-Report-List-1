<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Ultrasound Coagulating Cutter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-frequency ultrasound coagulating cutter market is segmented into monopolar and bipolar types. Monopolar cutters utilize a single electrode to deliver energy through the patient’s body to a grounding pad, allowing for deeper tissue penetration. In contrast, bipolar cutters employ two electrodes, delivering energy directly between them, resulting in more controlled coagulation and minimal surrounding tissue damage. Both technologies are essential in surgical procedures for precise cutting and coagulation, enhancing patient outcomes and surgical efficiency.</p></p>
